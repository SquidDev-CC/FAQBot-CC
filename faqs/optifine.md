title: OptiFine Compatibility
search: optifine

OptiFine is known to be [incompatible with many mods, including CC: Tweaked](<https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/7395>). If you are experiencing problems with peripherals not connecting, and you have OptiFine installed, you will need to remove OptiFine.

For performance improvements, we recommend **[Sodium](<https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium>)** (NeoForge/Fabric) or **[Embeddium](<https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium>)** (Forge). For shaders, [Iris](<https://modrinth.com/mod/iris>) (NeoForge/Fabric) or [Oculus](<https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus>) (Forge) are recommended.
