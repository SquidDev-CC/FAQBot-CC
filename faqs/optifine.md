---
Optifine is known to be [incompatible with many mods, including CC: Tweaked](<https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/7395>). If you are experiencing problems with peripherals not connecting, and you have Optifine installed, you will need to remove Optifine.

There are many replacement mods available for Optifine's functionality. You don't need all of theseâ€”you can pick just the ones you need.
